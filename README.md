# COVID-19-Face-Mask-Detector-with-OpenCV-Keras-TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning
 have implemented a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow. I will use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results. Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, I will proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to: Detect COVID-19 face masks in images Detect face masks in real-time video streams
